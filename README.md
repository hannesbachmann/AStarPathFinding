# AStarPathFinding
an algorithm to find the shortest legal path between two points

Inside the AStarPathFinding.py file exists a function called 'find_shortest_path(start_position, goal_position, grid_dim, black_fields)'.                                                                   
It takes:
            start_position    |     [x, y]                  
            goal_position     |     [x, y]                  
            grid_dim          |     [width, height]                     
            black_fields      |     [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]]
